- Fixing Database/Passenger
  - Found credentials with sudo EDITOR="nano" rails credentails:edit
  - added "cable:\n << *production" to database.yml
    - and queue and cache with the same format in the same file
  - used sudo RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
  - evaluate with "sudo /usr/bin/passenger-config validate-install"
  - commented out Passenger Load from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/passenger.load (the only line in the file) since there's a conflict between it and the load in /etc/apache2/apache.conf

- Experimenting with CSRF token. Added some functions into the html files? Doesn't seem to work.

10/17/2025
- Error seems to be that HTML files should be under app folder, not public folder, since all assets in public are static. 
- Attempting to move over HTML pages to app folder under views/nanospace to have Apache2 serve webpage with CSRF token and layouts applied.
    - (FIXED) importing index.html directory seems to break the home page. working on a fix. accessible under new views/nanospace folder or https://nanotoon.cs.rpi.edu/nanospace
    - renamed original nanospace.html in public, since it was getting loaded instead of the nanospace/index.html.erb file
    - moving over nanospace_with_alt_text html file similar to index.html (now index.html.erb)


10/21/2025
- Moved static index.html and nanospace_with_alt_text.html pages into app folder and made into .html.erb files. Debugged resulting errors from moving over. Reverted changes to nanospace_with_alt_text.html file that tried to fix CSRF tokens.

10/24/2025
- Bugfixed CSRF tokens. Authlogic needs to be updated because it's using deprecated features.
  - Edited user_sessions_controllers.rb
    - added ".to_h" in create
    - commented out old token function
    - added "def user_session_params" with :name and :password
    - fix remaining issues in new and create functions of user_sessions_controllers.rb

10/28/2025
- Routing errors for authlogic fixed
- SSL issues regarding deprecated pem file resolved
- Invalid CSRF token error returning?
- added new CSRF token thing at top of /public/js/users.js
  - seems not to have worked. giving error 400 bad request rather than 422 unprocessable content

10/31/2025
- Added users_params function at bottom of users_controllers.rb
  - after debugging function, now gives error 500 internal network error instead of error 400 bad request. error log recommends downloading SCrypt for Authlogic
    - SCrypt seems sufficient as a hashing algorithm, but is not added yet. Probably next on TODO list.

11/4/2025
- Added SCrypt to Gemfile, sudo bundle install used to download
- Added lines to beginning of file /app/models/user.rb
  - acts_as_authentic do |c|
        c.crypto_provider = ::Authlogic::CryptoProviders::SCrypt
    end
  - additionally added validation lines right under above lines
- with these changes, login/signup seems to work, but requires more testing

11/7/2025
- Updating GitHub Code with seemingly working login system
- Begin testing of Login/Signup
  - Username area does not allow for capital letters. Error "Oops! name should use only letters and numbers."
    - Fixed in validates of user.rb

11/11/2025
- Swapped Vimeo video player in theater of park over to Youtube video player.
- Edited statically served home page to link to https://nanotoon.cs.rpi.edu/park (served through rails) instead of https://nanotoon.cs.rpi.edu/nanospace_with_alt_text (old and static)
  - note that park links to app/views/nanospace/park1.html.erb as defined in routes in case this is not clear
