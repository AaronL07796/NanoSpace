- Fixing Database/Passenger
  - Found credentials with sudo EDITOR="nano" rails credentails:edit
  - added "cable:\n << *production" to database.yml
    - and queue and cache with the same format in the same file
  - used sudo RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
  - evaluate with "sudo /usr/bin/passenger-config validate-install"
  - commented out Passenger Load from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/passenger.load (the only line in the file) since there's a conflict between it and the load in /etc/apache2/apache.conf

- Experimenting with CSRF token. Added some functions into the html files? Doesn't seem to work.

10/17/2025
- Error seems to be that HTML files should be under app folder, not public folder, since all assets in public are static. 
- Attempting to move over HTML pages to app folder under views/nanospace to have Apache2 serve webpage with CSRF token and layouts applied.
    - (FIXED) importing index.html directory seems to break the home page. working on a fix. accessible under new views/nanospace folder or https://nanotoon.cs.rpi.edu/nanospace
    - renamed original nanospace.html in public, since it was getting loaded instead of the nanospace/index.html.erb file
    - moving over nanospace_with_alt_text html file similar to index.html (now index.html.erb)


10/21/2025
- Moved static index.html and nanospace_with_alt_text.html pages into app folder and made into .html.erb files. Debugged resulting errors from moving over. Reverted changes to nanospace_with_alt_text.html file that tried to fix CSRF tokens.
