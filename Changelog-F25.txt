- Attempting to fix Database/Passenger
  - Removed config.active_storage.service = :local in attempt to remove active storage from transition from Rails 5-6 in all ruby files in /var/www/nanospace/server/config/environments
  - Commented out line  Rails.application.config.assets.version = "1.0" from /var/www/nanospace/server/config/initializers/assets.rb

- Fixing Database/Passenger
  - Found credentials with sudo EDITOR="nano" rails credentails:edit
  - added "cable:\n << *production" to database.yml
    - and queue and cache with the same format in the same file
  - used sudo RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
  - evaluate with "sudo /usr/bin/passenger-config validate-install"

  - commented out Passenger Load from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/passenger.load (the only line in the file) since there's a conflict between it and the load in /etc/apache2/apache.conf
