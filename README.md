# NanoSpace
The Molecularium® Project’s mission is to expand science literacy and awareness. It aims to excite audiences of all ages to explore and understand the molecular nature of the world around them. It does so through compelling stories, experiential learning and unprecedented visualizations in immersive and interactive media. 

The Molecularium® Project was the flagship outreach and education effort of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s Nanotechnology Center – bringing audiences worldwide into the amazing nanoscale world of atoms and molecules. (https://molecularium.com/about.html)

NanoSpace is the web-based, virtual theme park for the project with games, activities and short animations to explore the world of atoms and molecules. When RPI instituted Crowdstrike security software to all of its servers, the operating system on the server being used for NanoSpace  was deemed not compliant and NanoSpace was taken off the internet, though it is still available on RPI’s network.  

This project is associated with RPI's Rensselaer Center for Open Source. (https://handbook.rcos.io/)
