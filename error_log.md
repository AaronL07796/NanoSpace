* Modify `before_filter` to `before_action` in games_controller.rb, achievements_controller.rb, and users_controller.rb.
* Currently working on: `apache2: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.1.1. Set the 'ServerName' directive globally to suppress this message`
